Dear Students,

attached are the files related to the project. Below is a detailed 
description of the project.

If you have any questions related to the description, feel free to ask.

Notice that there might be some supplementary material files for some 
papers (no need to study in depth those papers).
Those papers allow you to better understand the contents.

Below are group number, project description and some collaboration guidelines.

Cheers,
    Francesco Rinaldi

7) Optimization Methods for Recommender Systems

- analyze in depth the theory of the papers (FW.pdf, FW_variants.pdf, 
FW_survey.pdf)


3 STUDENTS:
- develop the codes for the following algorithms:  Frank-Wolfe, 
Pairwise Frank-Wolfe, Away-Step  Frank-Wolfe; please use suitable 
tools to make the code efficient (e.g., line search, LMO,...).
- test the algorithms on the the Matrix completion Problem  (Section 
3.4  in FW_survey.pdf) using 3 Real-World Data Sets  (see, e.g., 
https://paperswithcode.com/datasets?task=recommendation-systems - 
suitably choose the data you like the most)
-analize the results using plots and tables
